The project's objective was to understand the order pattern of the customers for the last 6 months.

 # CUSTOMER ANALYTICS:
 The use of data to comprehend the structure, requirements, and satisfaction of the customer is known as customer analytics. Moreover, the technology that makes it possible to group customers based on their activity, identify broad patterns, or create focused marketing and sales initiatives.
 
 # NEED FOR CUSTOMER ANALYTICS
 
Information regarding where to obtain goods and services, what to buy, and what to anticipate to spend is readily available to customers in the digital age. Organizations must make every effort to offer their audience the best products and marketing strategies possible because they can easily find the ones that will meet their needs. Organizations can do this by using technologies for customer analytics to comprehend their customers.
In order to make judgements about how to effectively attract and hold onto new consumers, customer analytics aims to develop a single, accurate image of an organization's client base. Additionally, it can identify clients with high value and provide proactive ways to engage them.
The customer journey can be optimised by businesses that have a thorough understanding of the purchasing patterns and lifestyle preferences of their clients. Large quantities of precise data are necessary for accurate analysis. Without it, analysis insights could be completely off and useless.

# METHODOLOGY
Consumer Data Analysis for a Food Ordering App was my SQL project. Understanding the customers' ordering habits was the project's main goal. The swiggy app data was used to gather the sample data. The information included bill amount, order date, outlet, bill amount, customer ID, order ID, partner code, and remarks. My tasks included finding the most recent orders placed by consumers, creating a table with unique records, counting the duplicates in the sample data, and analysing the total number of orders, by customer and outlet, as well as the total bill amount.
For creating the SQL queries, I utilised the window function, group by, having, where clause, if function, common table expression, and nested querie

# CONCLUSION

The use of SQL as the query language for understanding of RDBMS and use of SQL expressions for the better understanding of the MySQL workbench.
